<!--
    Directives are fundamental to Angular and are markers on a DOM element that tell AngularJS's HTML
    compiler to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners),
    or even to transform the DOM element and its children. Read about them here:

    https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive

    There are many directives built in to Angular. These are prefixed with "ng". In HTML the directives names are
    dash-delimited but are in camelCase elsewhere. So the ngApp directive below is used in HTML as ng-app.

    The ngApp directive is used to auto-bootstrap an AngularJS application. The ngApp directive designates
    the root element of the application and is typically placed near the root
    element of the page - e.g. on the <body> or <html> tags. Read about it here:

    https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngApp

    There are 3 important things that happen during the app bootstrap:
    - The injector that will be used for dependency injection is created.
    - The injector will then create the root scope that will become the context for the model of our application.
    - Angular will then "compile" the DOM starting at the ngApp root element, processing any directives and bindings found along the way.

              The ng-model directive allows us to perform two-way data binding which
              is one of the key features of Angular:
